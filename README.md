frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is a clone of the classic arcade game frogger.

I completed this project for Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

Feel free to review the code or to play it!

Game Controls:

Use the arrow keys to move the character up, down, right and left. Once you reach the water you win and the game will be reset.
